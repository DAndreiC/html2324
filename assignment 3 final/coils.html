                <p>Pupin&apos;s 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called &quot;Pupin coils&quot;, followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin&apos;s patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), making him wealthy. Although AT&amp;T bought Pupin&apos;s patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell&apos;s own patent. AT&amp;T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
